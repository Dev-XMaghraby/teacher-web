- Use of minimalist icons in gold to match the primary color scheme. Icons should be clear and easily recognizable, enhancing the user interface without clutter.
- A structured layout that is easy to navigate. Key sections (e.g., exams, explanations, literary works) should be clearly distinguished through use of dividers and spacing.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user interaction, such as a fade-in effect on content loading or a slide-in animation for navigation menus.
